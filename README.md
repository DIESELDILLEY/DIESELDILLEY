- 👋 Hi, I’m @DIESELDILLEY
- 👀 I’m interested in finding some projects so I can continue to build my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning your basics.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn from someone who will guide me because I'm 
a beginner at 43 years of age.  Reasons are because I injured my back 
while in the Navy.  And I truly want to still be a productive member of society. 
My prior background is I. Chemistry. 
- 📫 How to reach me.
